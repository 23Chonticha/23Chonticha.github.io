            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Chonticha Jittam, and I am a student currently studying Electronic and 
            Computer Systems at Silpakorn University.I have an interest in programming, especially in web development,
            as well as in writing code for various applications, such as controlling robots or measuring 
            temperature. I am committed to continuously developing my skills and expanding my knowledge 
            in these areas.</p>

                <ul>
                    <a>I have a tendency to take on too many projects at once because 
                    I want to help and be involved in everything. </a><br>
                    <a>I tend to overthink and analyze things deeply, which can sometimes delay decision-making. </a><br>
                    <a>I tend to get frustrated when things don't go as expected or when progress is slow.</a>
